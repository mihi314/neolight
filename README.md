neolight
========

The standard german keyboard layout really sucks for programming.
The neo layout is awesome, but sucks when you don't want to go through the pain of relearning a new layout and having messed up shortcuts in all kinds of applications and games.
Neolight solves both problems by converting Capslock and # to modifier keys that activate neo's third layer, which has all the special characters needed for programming.
